TODO
    - Change the url that is used to connect to mongo-db
        - change 127.0.0.1 as mongodb
    
    - Creates Dockerfiles for each services which are product-app and mongo. (I may use the original mongo image as database service)

    - I can try create the image belong to the product app and run the image with mongodb (mongodb will run manuelly)

    - Then configure the docker-compose.yml to make everything systematically and auto-control by linux kernel.

    - Look at the article on medium that related to docker-node.js and my node-mongo-docker app when configuring the app as image and container.
        - `https://medium.com/zenofai/how-to-build-a-node-js-and-mongodb-application-with-docker-containers-15e535baabf5`

    - Put the docker container on digital ocean
